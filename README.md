this is the home page of 5166 gamez

mind you this is EXTREMELY bare bones as switching to github from google sites may take me some time to actually learn how github sites work

for anyone wondering, my school domain actually blocked EVERYONE from using google sites completely, at first it was just blocking anyone from using google sites that wasnt within our domain, and then this year they just blocked it entirely, so i also lost all my progress to the original 5166 gamez which was hosted on google sites

now,,, since ive switched to github, i think the amount of stuff that can be done here will be IMMACULATE!!
